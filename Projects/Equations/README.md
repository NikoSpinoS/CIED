# Equations-Solution-Application
The current repository contains applications (.c) that can be used for primary and quadric equations solutions.

# Primary Equation Solution Application (P.E.S.A)
This code contains a program which finds the solution of a primary equation. Once the user assigns a number in the variables a,b and c, the solution will be printed.

# Quadric Equation Solution Application (Q.E.S.A)
This code contains a program which finds solutions of a quadric equation. Once the user assigns a number in the variables a,b and c, the solution(s) will be printed.
